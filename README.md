SublimeLinterFortran
================================

Small [SublimeLinter](https://github.com/SublimeLinter/SublimeLinter) plugin for Fortran. It works best on free-format Fortran files and provides minimal linting capabilities. For something more complete, see the [SublimeFortran](https://github.com/315234/SublimeFortran.git) project.

## Installation

Clone this repo into your `Packages` directory.

### Requirements

You need to have `SublimeLinter` and `gfortran` on your system for the plugin to work.  In addition, ensure that `gfortran` is available on SublimeLinter's path. See the docs for [troubleshooting PATH configuration](http://sublimelinter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/troubleshooting.html#finding-a-linter-executable).
