SublimeLinterFortran
================================

This plugin for [SublimeLinter](https://github.com/SublimeLinter/SublimeLinter) provides support for [gfortran](https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GFortran) linting on Sublime Text. It works better on free-format Fortran files. The code is highly inpired by the [SublimeFortran](https://github.com/315234/SublimeFortran.git) linter, however some changes have been introduced to simplify and improve the regex matching.

## Installation

Clone this repo into your `Packages` directory.

### Rquirements

You need to have `SublimeLinter` and `gfortran` on your system for the plugin to work.  In addition, ensure that `gfortran` is available on SublimeLinter's path. See the docs for [troubleshooting PATH configuration](http://sublimelinter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/troubleshooting.html#finding-a-linter-executable).
